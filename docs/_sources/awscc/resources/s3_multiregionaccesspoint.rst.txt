          BlockPublicPolicy:
            description: Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies
              for buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes Amazon
              S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the specified bucket policy allows
              public access. Enabling this setting doesn't affect existing bucket policies.

            description: Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for buckets

              all public ACLs on buckets in this account and any objects that they contain.
              Enabling this setting doesn't affect the persistence of any existing ACLs
              and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set.

              has a public policy.

              Enabling this setting doesn''t affect previously stored bucket policies,
