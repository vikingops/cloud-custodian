          ContainerPort:
            description: The port on the container to associate with the load balancer.
              This port must correspond to a containerPort in the task definition the
              tasks in the service are using. For tasks that use the EC2 launch type,
              the container instance they are launched on must allow ingress traffic on
              the hostPort of the port mapping.
            type: integer
          LoadBalancerName:
            description: The name of the load balancer to associate with the Amazon ECS
              service or task set. A load balancer name is only specified when using a
              Classic Load Balancer. If you are using an Application Load Balancer or
              a Network Load Balancer this should be omitted.
            type: string
          TargetGroupArn:
            description: The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Elastic Load Balancing
              target group or groups associated with a service or task set. A target group
              ARN is only specified when using an Application Load Balancer or Network
              Load Balancer. If you are using a Classic Load Balancer this should be omitted.
              For services using the ECS deployment controller, you can specify one or
              multiple target groups. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/register-multiple-targetgroups.html
              in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. For services using
              the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, you are required to define two target
              groups for the load balancer. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-bluegreen.html
              in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. If your service's
              task definition uses the awsvpc network mode (which is required for the
              Fargate launch type), you must choose ip as the target type, not instance,
              when creating your target groups because tasks that use the awsvpc network
              mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2
              instance.
